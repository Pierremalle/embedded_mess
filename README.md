# embedded_mess

This repository aims to contain all my projects related to embedded programming.
All of those are an attempt to learn by myself and gain proficiency with hardware-software connection.

In each subrepository, you'll find an indivudal project with all dependencies and conceptual documents such as KiCAD schemas.

To develop those project, i'll be using PlatformIO.
